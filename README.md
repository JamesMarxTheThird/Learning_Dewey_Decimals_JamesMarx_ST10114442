---> Starting the Shelf Order activity <---
-> -> Home Page <- <-

> You are first presented with a home page that has 2 hyperlinks and 3 image buttons.

> The hyperlinks are extra information about the dewey decimal system as the user may need a referesher.

> The buttons will all link to a different activity, but as of now the only avalilable one is the shelf order.

> The user can click the shelf order button and will be directed to the activity page.

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\

---> How to play <---
-> -> Shelf Order Page <- <-

> The main objective is to re-order the books, ascending, according to the dewey decimal system.

> On the shelf in the center of the screen, 10 books with random call numbers will be displayed.

> The aim is the click on a book, and then click either the right or left arrow button below the books (or A and D keys) to shift it.

> After clicking all the books and moving them to their correct place, the user would click the check button at the bottom center.

> This button will prompt the user on their outcome and hint at the next, advised action to take based on the result.

> The reset button, next to the check button is there for simplicity and ease of use. It will reset the call numbers displayed at any given time
and even will reset based on what game mode is currently selected. It can also be trigered with the F5 key, as if its refreshing.
(It is not cheating to restart, its there incase anything goes wrong during the gameplay, and the user may want to reset.)

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\

---> User Help <---
-> -> Shelf Order Page <- <-

There are 3 in-app help features designed for ease-of-use.

The first two are under the options panel and are labelled:

> What to do

This is a smaller form that shows over the main describing all aspects of this game so users know exactly what to do.

> How to play

This is another, smaller form displayed to show the user a table of all the input controls to use the app.

Lastly there is the "toggle label hints"

This is a toggle button that hides and shows label hinting at components' features and hotkeys incase the user is in a game and quickly wants to understand something
better and without losing focus.
